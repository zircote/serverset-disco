Zookeeper ServerSet Discovery Plugin for Elasticsearch
======================================================

The plan is that by using zookeeper serversets for elasticsearch discovery they necesity for a mesos framework or anyother means
to find other instances in the given ES cluster become irrelevant. Additionally ephemeral ports
may be implemented.


The addition of an announcer plugin would also server to further the usability of this puglin for horizontal scaling.
